Brawl Pass (premium rewards track for each season).
Skins (cosmetic upgrades for Brawlers).
Mega Boxes and Big Boxes (loot boxes for unlocking Brawlers and resources).
Other exclusive in-game items and offers.

Brawl Pass Free Track: Every season, the free track of the Brawl Pass provides small amounts of gems as rewards.
Special Events and Challenges: Occasionally, Supercell introduces special events or challenges that may reward gems.
Trophy Road: Some gem rewards are available as you progress through the Trophy Road.
Promotions and Giveaways: Supercell or official community creators may host legitimate gem giveaways.
3. Are Gem Generators Real?
No, gem generators are fake and often scams. They can:

Steal your account information.
Install malware on your device.
Violate Supercell’s Terms of Service, potentially resulting in a permanent account ban.
4. How Many Free Gems Can I Earn in a Season?
On the free track of the Brawl Pass, you can typically earn 90 gems per season, depending on the season's rewards.

5. Can I Get Free Gems Without Spending Real Money?
While you can earn gems for free through gameplay (as mentioned above), earning enough for expensive purchases, like the premium Brawl Pass or exclusive skins, might take several seasons.

6. Are There Legitimate Ways to Get Gems Outside the Game?
Yes, here are some indirect but legitimate methods:

Google Play Rewards / Apple Gift Cards: Use surveys or promotions to earn store credits, which can then be spent on gems.
Community Tournaments and Contests: Participate in official or community-organized tournaments or events with gems as prizes.
7. What’s the Best Use of Gems?
To maximize your gems:

Save up for the Brawl Pass, as it provides the best value for gems.
Spend on limited-time exclusive skins if you're a collector.
Avoid spending gems on loot boxes (Mega Boxes or Big Boxes), as their value for progression is low.
8. Can I Earn Gems Faster?
Earning free gems is tied to the game’s progression and events, so focus on:

Playing daily and completing quests for the Brawl Pass rewards.
Participating in special challenges or seasonal events.
9. Are Free Gem Hacks Safe?
No. Any website or tool claiming to give free gems through hacking violates Supercell’s Terms of Service. These methods are unsafe and will likely compromise your account or device.

Avoid interacting or sharing your details.
Report them to Supercell Support or through their official channels.
